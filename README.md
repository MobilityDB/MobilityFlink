MobilityFlink explores the advantages of [MobilityDB](https://github.com/MobilityDB/MobilityDB) datatypes and functions in the Flink environment, using the [JMEOS](https://github.com/MobilityDB/JMEOS) library as middleware.

The MobilityDB project is developed by the Computer & Decision Engineering Department of the [Université libre de Bruxelles](https://www.ulb.be/) (ULB) under the direction of [Prof. Esteban Zimányi](http://cs.ulb.ac.be/members/esteban/). ULB is an OGC Associate Member and member of the OGC Moving Feature Standard Working Group ([MF-SWG](https://www.ogc.org/projects/groups/movfeatswg)).
